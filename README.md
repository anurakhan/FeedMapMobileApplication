# FeedMapMobileApplication
FeedMap is an IOS app that shows to the user highly rated dishes, eg., Ice Cream, Ramen, etc.
Created using Xamarin.

This app consists of IOS client application and web api.

Code refactoring was done, however it still needs more.

Improvments to come:
Move the manual data write from web api to a seperate client web application to seperate the concerns in the web service.
More refcatoring in IOS app.
Add collection of images to BottomSheetViewContainers.
