# FeedMapMobileApplication
FeedMap is an IOS app that shows to the user highly rated dishes, eg., Ice Cream, Ramen, etc.
Created using Xamarin.

This app consists of IOS client application and web api.

Code refactoring was done, however it still needs more.

Improvments to Come:
Move the manual data write from web api to a seperate client web application to seperate the concerns in the web service.
More refactoring in iOS app and web api app.
Server side implementation of user login and registration.

Recently Added Features:
Added client side UI for registering and loging in users.
Redesigned the system for the users to be able to view media content associated with food markers.
