# FeedMapMobileApplication
FeedMap is an IOS app that allows users to store their favorite dishes (gems) in their city or local region in a comfortable format. In the future, special algorithims will be deployed to recommend to you new and exciting food dishes!

Server side implementation of user login and registration.
Web Api Authentication.
