# FeedMapMobileApplication
FeedMap is an IOS app that allows users to store their favorite dishes (gems) in their city or local region in a comfortable format. In the future, special algorithims will be deployed to recommend to you new and exciting food dishes! 
Created using Xamarin.

This app consists of an IOS client application and web api.


Improvments to Come:
Move the manual data write from web api to a seperate client web application to seperate the concerns in the web service.
Post data from mobile app.


Recently Added Features:
Added client side UI for registering and loging in users.
Redesigned the system for the users to be able to view media content associated with food markers.
Server side implementation of user login and registration.
Web Api Authentication.
Secure SSL networking.
More refactoring in iOS app and web api app.
Implemented Token Manager instance.

Note:
To build this project one must calibrate his own WebApiCred object and appsetting.json.
